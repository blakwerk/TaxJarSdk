# TaxJarSdk

This is a simple demo SDK connecting to the tax jar API to calculate taxes and tax rates and the like. It demonstrates integrating to two particular endpoints - one to get the tax rates for a location, and the other to calculate the taxes for an order.

The project includes a sample console app to demonstrate its functionality - just set the Runner project as startup and launch.
